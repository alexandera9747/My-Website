- Statics 
- dynamics 
- kinematics 
- fluid mechanics all come under the category 
- Statics as you may know is the study of objects at rest and dynamics is the study of objects in motion.

### Description of mechanical engineering
- **Mechanical engineering**, design power-producing machines such as electric generators, internal combustion engines, and steam and gas turbines, as well as power-using machines such as refrigeration and air-conditioning systems.
